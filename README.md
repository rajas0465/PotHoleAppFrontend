# **Pothole Reporting System**

A React Native application with an Expo-managed workflow for reporting and managing potholes. This app allows users to submit pothole reports with images and geolocation data and enables administrators to receive alerts for potholes in their geographical areas. Admins can track, review, and resolve pothole reports in real time.
